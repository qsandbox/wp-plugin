Allow your clients to setup a demo site on qSandbox.com without leaving your site.

== Description ==

This plugin interacts with the qSandbox platform. You need a qSandbox account to use it.
Some functionality such as Demo Sites require you to have a minimum plan.

After the plugin is setup your users will only need to click one button and the demo will be created.
They will also be automatically logged in.

= Demo Site Functionality =
Allow your clients to test drive your plugins or themes in a private demo site without leaving your site (by inserting a sidebar widget).
The demo site expires after certain amount of time.

= Setup =
1. Join / Login into qSandbox
1. Upgrade if your plan is not good enough. See qSandbox.com/app/pricing.php for more info.
1. Create a demo setup ( qSandbox.com > Dashboard > Demo Site ) and define which plugins and themes to be pre-installed on each demo site.
1. Copy or generate an API key from qSandbox > Settings > API / Integrations
1. Add the API key in the qSandbox plugin's settings page ( WP Admin > Settings > qSandbox )
1. Go to Appearance > Widgets and add the *qSandbox Demo Site Widget* to a your sidebar or footer and select the demo setup (if you have more than 1)
1. Save changes and view your site.
1. Click on the *Go!* button and in a few seconds you will see a brand new demo site with all the selected themes and plugins preinstalled.

This plugin will register a widget that will communicate with qSandbox.com and will simplify the temporary demo site creation.
